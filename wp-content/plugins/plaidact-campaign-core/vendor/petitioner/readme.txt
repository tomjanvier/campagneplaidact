Create, target, and track high-impact petitions with Petitioner: automate delivery to decision-makers, manage approvals, and export rich submission data to CSV.

== Description ==

[Plugin homepage & demo](https://getpetitioner.com).

== Development and Source Code ==

The source code for this plugin is publicly available on GitHub:
[https://github.com/avoy18/petitioner](https://github.com/avoy18/petitioner)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I show the petition on my website? =

Create your first petition under Petitioner -> Add new. Once you do that, you can either use a shortcode provided on the creation page or a Gutenberg block.

= Can I collect petitions without sending emails? =

Absolutely. Sending a petition letter to a representative is optional. Just disable the rep email inside the petition’s Email tab and submissions will still be stored, displayed, and exportable.

= How can I prevent unwanted submissions or spam? =

Enable one (or more) of the built‑in defenses: reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha / Turnstile, Akismet integration, honeypot field under Advanced Settings, double opt-in email confirmations, manual approve/deny, and the ability to edit or delete entries directly from the Submissions tab. More guidance: https://getpetitioner.com/docs/captcha/

= How do I customize the styles? =

You can customize your petitions under Petitioner -> Settings. You can change the colors, conditionally display certain fields, and add custom CSS.

= How can I ensure petition emails don’t go to spam? =

Petitioner uses the WordPress `wp_mail()` function, so deliverability depends on your hosting. Install an SMTP plugin (e.g., WP SMTP) to route mail through a trusted sender. You can also disable the “Send this email to a representative?” option to avoid sending hundreds of identical letters and damaging your domain reputation.

= How do I see and export the submissions? =

Simply open the edit page for the petition in question and you will see a table with all of the submissions. There will also be a button to export. You can also filter out unwanted submissions before exporting.

= How can I display the submissions on the frontend? =

Insert either the Gutenberg “Petitioner Submissions” block or the `[petitioner_submissions]` shortcode wherever you want the signatures to appear. Full walk-through: https://getpetitioner.com/docs/show-submissions-on-the-frontend/

= Can I redirect users to a specific page after they sign? =
Yes. In the petition settings, you can define custom redirect URLs for successful submissions, email confirmations, and even error states.

= Does the plugin support incremental goals? =
Yes! The milestones feature lets you set multiple signature targets so you can celebrate progress as your campaign grows.

= Is it developer-friendly? =
Very. The plugin exposes dozens of filters, actions, and JavaScript events plus helper shortcodes for rendering counts, goals, progress bars, popups, and more. See the full extension reference at https://getpetitioner.com/docs/filters-and-hooks/

= Can I request features? =

Absolutely! Feel free to reach out through [this contact form](https://getpetitioner.com/contact/)
